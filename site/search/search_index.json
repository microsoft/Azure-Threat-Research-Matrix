Clicking on a specific tactic will list the techniques specific to it. Clicking on a specific technique will bring you to the page on that technique and the details around it. You can also utilize the search bar at the top to recursively search for specific text. For example, to search for what techniques a certain action or permission has, just enter the action in the search bar and it will show all relevant techniques. When viewing the page of a technique, specific examples of how to abuse the technique with different methods are shown. By clicking on the given command, it will bring you to the documentation around it. Disclaimer The purpose of the Azure Threat Research Matrix (ATRM) is to educate readers on the potential of Azure-based tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs). It is not to teach how to weaponize or specifically abuse them. For this reason, some specific commands will be obfuscated or parts will be omitted to prevent abuse. Feedback With the intent of ATRM being a collaborative effort with the community, feedback is greatly appreciated. Is there a new or missing technique? Is the formatting off-putting?

Exfiltration in Azure consists of using techniques to lift resource data from specific resources. This can be done by generating SAS URIs for unauthenticated & persistent downloads, or can be done by directly exfiltrating the data from the resource itself. ID Name Description AZT701 SAS URI Generation By generating an SAS URI for a resource, an adversary may extract the contents of that resource without authentication at any time. .001 VM Disk SAS URI An adversary may create an SAS URI to download the disk attached to a virtual machine. .002 Storage Account File Share SAS By generating a Shared Access Signature (SAS) URI, an adversary can access a container in a Storage Account at any time. AZT702 File Share Mounting An adversary may attach an Azure resource as a file share .001 Storage Account File Share NFS/SMB Mount An adversary can generate a connection string to mount an Azure Storage Account File Share as an NFS or SMB share to their local machine. AZT703 Replication An adversary may exfiltrate data by replicating it. .001 Storage Account Replication By setting up cross-tenant replication, an adversary may set up replication from one tenant's storage account to an extrenal tenant's storage account.","title":"Exfiltration"},{"location":"Exfiltration/AZT701/AZT701-1/","text":"AZT701.1 - SAS URI Generation: VM Disk SAS URI # An adversary may create an SAS URI to download the disk attached to a virtual machine.
